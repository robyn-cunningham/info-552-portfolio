            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I work at <a href="https://library.eastern.edu/" target="_blank">Warner Library</a> of <a href="https://www.eastern.edu/" target="_blank">Eastern University</a> as the Reference and Outreach Librarian. I specialize in independent research consultations, creating and managing <a href="https://libguides.eastern.edu/" target="_blank">research guides</a> for a wide array of subjects, and networking with the university community in order to understand their needs in order to implement helpful services to the library. Before becoming a librarian, I was promoted from working as Warner Library’s evening supervisor. My journey in higher education started several months after I was hired because I quickly learned that working in libraries was my passion, and I was promoted shortly after I began pursuing my MLIS degree from Drexel University. I also have a bachelor's of science degree in Anthropology, with a minor in Fine Art, from York College of Pennsylvania.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I create digital art by using Procreate on an iPad Pro. I specialize in fantasy and slice-of-life illustration. My art style varies from watercolor digital brushes to pixel art. I create personal art of my own imagination and fan art of beloved media to sell in my <a href="https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/havfruit/" target="_blank">online shop</a>, as well as commissioned pieces of various themes.</p>
            <p>My two passions in life differ quite a bit, but I find a lot of joy in each of them, and I am grateful to have the freedom to choose them both. For inquiries about either of my fields and how I can be of service to anyone looking for expertise in reference librarianship or digital art, please see my <a href="contact.html">Contact page</a>.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I like to spend time with my friends and my partner, write, read, paint with watercolors, and play games. I am also an avid mental health advocate.</p>
